# Game

This is an exercise as part of an Angular course.

### Assignment

- Create 4 components:
    - GameControls
    - Odd
    - Even
    - Container


- The GameControl Component should have 2 buttons:
  - Start
  - Stop


- Starting the game, an event (holding incrementing number) should get emitted each second.


- The event should be listenable from outside the component.


- When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted.


- A new component should get created for odd number, same goes for each even number.


- Output odd and even number components in separate columns inside the Container component.


- Style the element holding your output.
